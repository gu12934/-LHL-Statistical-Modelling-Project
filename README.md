# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals

In this project, we will combine and practice implementing what we have learned throughout this course, including:

*Accessing data using APIs

*Cleaning and transforming data using Python

*Loading data into a database using Python

*Performing EDA, including using both statistics and visualizations

*Identifying trends and patterns in data using statistical models

*Interpreting the results of the statistical models


## Process


Part 1: Connecting to CityBikes API

Part 2: Connecting to Foursquare and Yelp APIs

Part 3: Joining Data

Part 4: Building a Model

### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
